about=The UTerra plugin is designed to streamline the permitting process for long-haul fiber optic installations by analyzing a route's intersections with cities, counties, protected areas (PADUS), and railway crossings. With UTerra, users can easily identify which jurisdictions and special areas a route traverses and compile this information into a permitting report.
