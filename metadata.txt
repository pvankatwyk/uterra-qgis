about=The UTerra plugin is designed to streamline the permitting process for long-haul fiber optic installations by analyzing a route's intersections with cities, counties, protected areas (PADUS), and railway crossings. With UTerra, users can easily identify which jurisdictions and special areas a route traverses and compile this information into a permitting report.

Features:
- **Intersection Analysis**: Automatically identifies intersecting cities, counties, protected areas, and railways along the route.
- **Permitting Report Generation**: Outputs a detailed Markdown report listing each intersected area with contact and permitting information.
- **Optional AI Integration**: Users with an OpenAI API key can generate enhanced summaries that include permitting links and contextual information for each intersected jurisdiction or feature.

This tool is ideal for infrastructure planning and environmental compliance, providing a convenient, location-specific overview of permitting requirements in a single, organized report.
